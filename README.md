<!-- Description -->
[Devmate][homepageURL] is an UI application to help you log your development features. You'll like Devmate because it is lightweight and uses a friendly and minimalist UI. Devmate is not better than other existing solutions, but it can help you make a quick overview of the workflow of your development projects. All your logs will be saved directly into the local storage of your browser.

You are free to reuse, copy, modify, and distribute, but you have to give attribution.

## Technologies & Tools
[Devmate][homepageURL] is created with:
* [Angular 10][angularURL] : Frontend framework
* [Node.js][nodeURL] : Runtime environment
* [Angular CLI][angularCliURL] : Frontend scaffolding
* [Bulma][BulmaURL] : Layout and styles
* [Font Awesome][fontAwesomeURL] : icons

## Prerequisites
Before installing [Devmate][homepageURL] you need to:
1. Install [Node.js][nodeURL]
2. Install Angular CLI : `npm i -g @angular/cli`

## Installation and configuration

### Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kuohamkun/devmate.git
cd devmate
```
### Install npm packages
Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

## Run
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will run and it will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help
This project was generated with [Angular CLI][angularCliGH] version 10.0.4. <br/>
